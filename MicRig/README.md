Over-the-ear mic rig.

Designed in Blender.
Print using TPU, then paint the outer side to suit the actor and match the microphone used.

Designed for Countryman B3 microphones.

Also requires a wire to complete the rig. I used 19ga stainless steel wire. Bends
easily enough, while maintaining its shape once bent. 

The portions of the wire that are not in the TPU rig are covered by silicone tubing.
The tubing I used has inner diameter of 1mm and outer diameter of 2mm. It slides
onto the stainless steel wire without too much effort. Leave a bit of excess tubing 
at the exposed end of the wire to ensure the wire doesn't poke the actor.

I shaped the wire to each actor before putting it in the rig. This let me adjust length
of the wire to their ear size. I also trimmed the rig to match the overall wire length.

After inserting the wire in the rig I added a few drops of superglue at a few points 
along the channel to hold it in place.

Once it was all set, then I added the mic to the rig. Obviously, you don't want to glue
the mic into the rig. 

In our first run of a show with a batch of 16 of these, on middleschool actors, we found 
it was necessary to use a piece of tape on the rig in front of the ear as well as a 
piece of tape on the mic cable behind the ear. We use Nexcare transparent tape. It's the 
only brand we've found that will stay in place. For the tape on the rig in front of the ear,
we tore the tape in half so it was half its usual width. We used full width tape behind the
ear on the mic cable.
