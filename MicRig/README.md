Over-the-ear mic rig.

Designed in Blender.
Print using TPU, then paint the outer side to suit the actor and match the microphone used.

Designed for Countryman B3 microphones.

Also requires a wire to complete the rig. I used 19ga stainless steel wire.
The portions of the wire that are not in the TPU rig are covered by silicone tubing.
The tubing I used has inner diameter of 1mm and outer diameter of 2mm. It slides
onto the stainless steel wire without too much effort. 
Leave a bit of excess tubing at the exposed end of the wire to ensure the wire
doesn't poke the actor.
